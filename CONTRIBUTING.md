# Contributing to Ora 

## AI Assistance Notice

If you are using any kind of AI assistance to contribute, this must be disclosed in your pull request, commit, or issue, including the extent to which AI assistance was used (e.g. docs only vs. code generation). 
If PR responses, commit messages, or comments are being generated by an AI, please disclose that as well. 

*As a small exception*, trivial tab-completion _doesn't_ need to be disclosed, so long as it is limited to single keywords or short phrases.

When using AI assistance, we expect contributors to understand the code that is produced and be able to answer critical questions about it. It isn't a maintainer's job to review a PR so broken that it requires significant rework to be acceptable.

Please be respectful to maintainers and disclose AI assistance.

## 🚀 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **macOS 14.0** or later
- **Xcode 15** or later (Swift 5.9)
- **Homebrew** (for developer tooling)

### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/the-ora/browser.git
   cd browser
   ```

2. Run the setup script to install tools, configure git hooks, and generate the Xcode project:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```

3. Open in Xcode and build:
   ```bash
   open Ora.xcodeproj
   ```
   In Xcode: select the `ora` scheme and Run (⌘R)

## 📝 Code Style & Standards

### Formatting & Linting

Code formatting and linting are automatically enforced via git hooks (installed by `./scripts/setup.sh`):

- **SwiftFormat**: Handles code formatting
- **SwiftLint**: Enforces coding standards

You can run these manually:
```bash
swiftformat . --quiet
swiftlint --quiet
```

### Conventions

- Follow existing SwiftUI/AppKit patterns in the codebase
- Use the established file organization structure
- **Prefer modern Swift/SwiftUI APIs** when possible

### Compatibility & OS Versions

- **Maintain backward compatibility**: The current minimum deployment target is **macOS 14.0**
- New features requiring newer OS versions should use `@available` or `#if available` checks to preserve compatibility
- **Discuss before raising minimum version**: If a feature would significantly benefit from raising the minimum OS version, open an issue to discuss the trade-offs before implementation

### Project Configuration

This project uses **XcodeGen**. If you need to modify project settings:

1. Edit `project.yml`
2. Regenerate the project: `xcodegen`

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

### Running Tests

- **In Xcode**: Product → Test (⌘U)
- **Via CLI**:
  ```bash
  xcodebuild test -scheme ora -destination "platform=macOS"
  ```

### Requirements

- All new features should include appropriate tests
- Existing tests must continue to pass
- Code should build without warnings

## 🔒 Security & Safety

- **Never commit private keys or sensitive data** - see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details
- Be mindful of user privacy and data handling
- Follow secure coding practices for web content handling

## 📋 Pull Request Process

### Before You Start

1. **Check for duplicates**: Search existing issues and PRs to ensure no one is already working on the same feature or bug
2. **Avoid duplicate work**: Comment on relevant issues to indicate you're working on them
3. For major changes, consider opening an issue first to discuss the approach

### Submitting Changes

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes, ensuring:
   - Code follows style guidelines (enforced by git hooks)
   - Tests pass
   - New functionality includes tests where appropriate

3. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages

4. Push to your fork and create a Pull Request

### PR Requirements

- [ ] Code builds successfully
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Code follows formatting standards (automatic via git hooks)
- [ ] **Descriptive title and description**: Clearly explain what changes were made and why
- [ ] Include screenshots if UI changes made
- [ ] References related issues if applicable
- [ ] No duplicate functionality (checked existing codebase)

## 🐛 Issue Reporting

### Bug Reports

**Be descriptive and thorough**. Include:
- macOS version
- Ora Browser version
- Clear steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Screenshots if applicable
- Relevant console/error messages

### Feature Requests

**Provide detailed context**. Include:
- Clear description of the feature and its use case
- Explain how it fits with Ora's goals (fast, secure, beautiful)
- Consider implementation complexity and user impact
- Check that similar functionality doesn't already exist

## 💬 Community Guidelines

- Be respectful and constructive
- Help maintain a welcoming environment for all contributors
- Focus on the code and ideas, not individuals

## Release Process

### Releases and Updates

Ora uses [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org/) for automatic updates. All build artifacts are organized in the `build/` directory.

1. **Add Sparkle dependency:**
   - Open `Ora.xcodeproj` in Xcode
   - Go to File → Add Packages...
   - Add `https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle` (version 2.6.3+)
   - Add Sparkle to your target

2. **Setup Sparkle tools:**
   ```bash
   brew install --cask sparkle
   ./setup-sparkle-tools.sh
   ./scripts/setup-sparkle.sh
   ```
   This generates DSA keys in `build/` directory.

3. **Configure signing:**
   - Copy the public key from `build/dsa_pub.pem` to your `Info.plist` as `SUPublicEDKey`
   - Keep `build/dsa_priv.pem` secure for signing releases
   - Add `SUFeedURL` to Info.plist pointing to your appcast.xml URL

4. **Create a release:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/create-release.sh 0.0.2 build/dsa_priv.pem
   ```
   This builds, signs, and prepares release files in `build/`.

5. **Host appcast.xml:**
   - Upload `build/appcast.xml` to a public URL (e.g., GitHub Pages)
   - Update `SUFeedURL` in `Info.plist` to point to your appcast.xml

6. **Publish release:**
   - Upload `build/Ora-Browser.dmg` to GitHub releases
   - Users will automatically receive update notifications

The app includes automatic update checking in Settings > General.

### Release Requirements

- [ ] Version number incremented appropriately
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code is properly signed
- [ ] Appcast.xml is updated with correct signatures
- [ ] DMG is uploaded to GitHub releases
