//
//  This file is a place to hold generally useful extensions of Splitter. If you create one,
//  please add your name below to identify your extension, add it to this file, and submit
//  a pull request. Note that your custom Splitter should probably conform to SplitDivider.
//  Your custom splitter can get its layout from the LayoutHolder in the Environment or
//  directly as part of its initialization.
