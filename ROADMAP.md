# üó∫Ô∏è Ora Browser Roadmap

Ora Browser is currently in **early development**.  
This roadmap tracks progress toward the **Beta** milestone and beyond.

> Goal: A stable, privacy-first macOS browser with a clean native interface.

# Known issues
- [] WebViews are stacked on top of eachother to avoid UI jumping round. To acheive this opacity 0|1 is used but this creates an issue where mouse hovering over a certain webview will trigger text in title attributes of webviews wthat are hidden under it.
- [] Dragging tabs around is not smooth and can produce empty tabs or weird spacings
- [] Favicons are selected from webpages according to size, there is no logic for selecting favicons based on theme or other options
- [] When a WebView is restored if there was developer tools open it won't neither open the dev tools or adject it's size back to the way it was
- [] The try again button after a page fails to load doesn't do anything
- [] If Ora is set as the default browser and is closed when a link is clicked on other apps, it won't create a new window properly.
