## Ora Browser

Ora is a fast, secure, and beautiful browser built for macOS. Inspired by Safari and Arc, Ora delivers a clean, native experience that feels at home on macOS — without unnecessary bloat.

> **⚠️ Disclaimer**  
> Ora is currently in early stages of development and **not yet ready for day-to-day use**. An alpha version with core functionalities will be released soon.

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 or later
- Xcode 15 or later (Swift 5.9)
- Homebrew (for developer tooling)
- Tools: `xcodegen`, `swiftlint`, `swiftformat` (installed by the setup script)
- Optional: `xcbeautify` (for prettier CLI build output)

## Key Management for Updates

Ora Browser uses Ed25519 cryptographic keys to sign and verify app updates for security:

### Public Key (Committed to Git)
- **File**: `ora_public_key.pem`
- **Purpose**: Verifies update signatures in the app
- **Status**: Committed to git repository
- **Safety**: Public keys are safe to share

### Private Key (Never Commit!)
- **File**: `.env` (contains `ORA_PRIVATE_KEY`)
- **Purpose**: Signs app updates during release
- **Status**: Never committed to git
- **Safety**: Keep secure and private

### Setup Process
1. **First machine**: Keys auto-generated and saved appropriately
2. **Additional machines**: Copy `.env` file from first machine
3. **Release process**: `./create-release.sh` handles key management automatically

### Security Notes
- `.env` is in `.gitignore` - it will never be committed
- Public key is committed - this is safe and required
- Never share your private key with anyone
- If private key is lost, you'll need to regenerate keys (breaks update chain)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/the-ora/browser.git
cd browser
```

2. Run the setup script to install tools, configure git hooks, and generate the Xcode project:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
3. Open in Xcode and run:
   ```bash
   open Ora.xcodeproj
   ```
   - In Xcode: select the `ora` scheme and Run (⌘R). Build (⌘B). Test (⌘U).

### Command-line build (optional)

- Debug build via helper script (uses `xcodebuild`; piping to `xcbeautify` if installed):
  ```bash
  ./xcbuild-debug.sh
  ```
  If you do not have `xcbeautify`, remove the final pipe or install it via Homebrew.

```

## Data and persistence

The app uses SwiftData with a single `ModelContainer` storing `TabContainer`, `History`, and `Download` models. The default store is under the app's Application Support directory as `OraData.sqlite`.

To reset the local store during development, you can delete the file under Application Support. Example path (your user folder will vary):

```bash
rm -f "$(getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR 2>/dev/null || echo "$HOME/Library/Application Support")/OraData.sqlite"*
```

> **⚠️ Caution: Use with care—this permanently clears tabs/history/download metadata.**

## Development

### Formatting and linting

- Run formatting:
  ```bash
  swiftformat . --quiet
  ```
- Run linting:
  ```bash
  swiftlint --quiet
  ```
- Pre-commit hook runs both automatically (installed by `./setup.sh`).

### Releases and Updates

Ora uses [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org/) for automatic updates. All build artifacts are organized in the `build/` directory.

1. **Add Sparkle dependency:**
   - Open `Ora.xcodeproj` in Xcode
   - Go to File → Add Packages...
   - Add `https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle` (version 2.6.3+)
   - Add Sparkle to your target

2. **Setup Sparkle tools:**
   ```bash
   brew install --cask sparkle
   ./setup-sparkle-tools.sh
   ./setup-sparkle.sh
   ```
   This generates DSA keys in `build/` directory.

3. **Configure signing:**
   - Copy the public key from `build/dsa_pub.pem` to your `Info.plist` as `SUPublicEDKey`
   - Keep `build/dsa_priv.pem` secure for signing releases
   - Add `SUFeedURL` to Info.plist pointing to your appcast.xml URL

4. **Create a release:**
   ```bash
   ./create-release.sh 0.0.2 build/dsa_priv.pem
   ```
   This builds, signs, and prepares release files in `build/`.

5. **Host appcast.xml:**
   - Upload `build/appcast.xml` to a public URL (e.g., GitHub Pages)
   - Update `SUFeedURL` in `Info.plist` to point to your appcast.xml

6. **Publish release:**
   - Upload `build/Ora-Browser.dmg` to GitHub releases
   - Users will automatically receive update notifications

The app includes automatic update checking in Settings > General.

### Regenerating the Xcode project

- Update `project.yml` as needed, then:
  ```bash
  xcodegen
  ```

### Running tests

- In Xcode: Product → Test (⌘U)
- Via CLI:
  ```bash
  xcodebuild test -scheme ora -destination "platform=macOS"
  ```

Keyboard shortcuts: see `ora/Common/Constants/KeyboardShortcuts.swift`.

## Troubleshooting

- XcodeGen, SwiftFormat, or SwiftLint not found
  - Run `./setup.sh` or install via Homebrew: `brew install xcodegen swiftformat swiftlint`
- Code signing issues (CLI builds)
  - The helper script disables signing for Debug builds. In Xcode, use automatic signing or adjust target settings.
- Missing `Ora.xcodeproj`
  - Run `xcodegen` (or `./setup.sh`) to regenerate from `project.yml`.
- CLI build output is hard to read
  - Install `xcbeautify` (`brew install xcbeautify`) and keep the pipe in `xcbuild-debug.sh`.
